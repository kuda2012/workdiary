                Hi, My name is Kuda Mwakutuya. I made this app because I felt a
                sense of dis-ease about how many months could go by at work with
                little hard proof of what I've been up to this whole time. This
                app gives you that security to say "Okay, I have been working
                hard. Look at what I was involved in each day." Use it to
                prepare for your performance reviews. If you've been pulling in
                your tabs each day, use it to hop back into a old problem you
                were solving. Ultimately, use it to give yourself peace of mind
                that you've not just been lollygagging at work all day. Many
                people have personal diaries...you spend most of your waking
                hours working...Why wouldn't it be good to have a Work Diary
                then? Of course it would be. Let me know how it goes. ‚úå
