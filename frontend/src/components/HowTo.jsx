                  Hey there, I made this app because I felt a sense of unease
                  about how many months could go by at work without much
                  evidence that I had done much the whole time. Then, when it
                  would come time to apply for new jobs, I would sit there
                  racking my brain trying to remember everything I had
                  accomplished on the job, how I felt about this line of
                  employment, etc. It just felt like work was one big black box
                  that I would show up to, participate in, and then leave from
                  without any solid proof that anything meaningful had happened
                  day to day. Given that work is such a fundamental aspect of
                  our lives, I believe it's in our best interest to stay on top
                  of what we tell ourselves about it. Let this app be a platform
                  for you to develop a richer mental narrative of your work
                  endeavors that will make you more compelling during job
                  interviews, networking events, or anytime you get a chance to
                  say your piece. Many people have personal diaries...you spend
                  most of your waking hours working...Why wouldn't it be good
                  idea to have a Workdiary then? Of course it would be. Let me
                  know how it goes. Peace âœŒ
